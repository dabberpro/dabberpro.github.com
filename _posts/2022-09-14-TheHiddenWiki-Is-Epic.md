# The Dark Web
The dark web is a loaded word. When one thinks of the dark web, they may think of illicit and illegal activities. However, it can be useful place to avoid censorship and have security as well. So, you may have a use for it. A quick search for Tor Browser allows you to access the dark web after installing it. However, once one loads up their Tor Browser, they often have the fundamental question: where to start?
# The Hidden Wiki
The place I wound myself in was the Hidden Wiki. It is a great place to access many links on the dark web, and I highly recommend it. Its URL is http://zqktlwiuavvvqqt4ybvgvi7tyo4hjl5xgfuvpdf6otjiycgwqbym2qad.onion/. Paste this into your Tor Browser to access The Hidden Wiki. Again, I highly recommend this for browsing the dark web. That's all I have for today. Signing off.
